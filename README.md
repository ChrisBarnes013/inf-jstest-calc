# inf-jstest-calc
Test for the JS Level 1 assessment for Infinity Dev Program

## Instructions

1. You've been provided HTML and CSS for a basic calculator. None of it works though ;)
2. You only need to implement the JS to make it work.
3. You shouldn't need to but feel free to modify the HTML and CSS.
4. The calculator should allow you to click number buttons (1 or many) and then an operation button (plus, minus or multiply) then some more number buttons (1 or many) and then finally, the equal button to output the result. To clear, press the C button and start again.
5. It is not necessary to allow users to add multiple numbers with just pressing the operation buttons, if you do implement that feature then it's will get bonus points.
6. The calculator does not need to support fractions or divisions.

Tips:

1. Remember to use parseInt() before you add/subtract/multiply the values https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
2. Use event listeners by using `addEventListener` https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
